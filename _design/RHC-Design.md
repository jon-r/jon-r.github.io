  <h2>Design</h2>
  <p>
  The Website at Red Hot Chilli is an online catalogue, using a custom-made CMS system built around the WordPress database functions. The site’s frontend is a responsive, fully featured design with a very lightweight footprint. The backend works off an existing database designed in Microsoft Access.

Using analytics from the previous site over two years, and from experience with customer inquiries, I have arranged the site to have the most requested information at the top of each page. The menu and search bar are at the same place on every page to aid navigation, with touch friendly buttons easy to use for mobile users.

The animated carousel was a more flashy replacement from the existing site. Although carousels are losing popularity, the team at Red Hot Chilli wanted a way to show off any special items that come along.

The biggest selling point of equipment are the photos. Red Hot Chilli make sure to use photos of the exact product for sale, with minimal editing to remove distracting surroundings.

A common problem with commercial equipment is giving the customer a sense of scale. Commercial equipment tends to be much larger than the domestic equivalent, and this is not always portrayed in the photos. I decided to add a dynamic scale reference on each item, so to help customers visualise how large equipment is.

As well as adding simple visual cues for the customer, I designed a set of SVG icons used to inform customer of common specs. For example, a question that comes up a lot is the power requirements. While many items can be plugged in to standard UK plug sockets, the higher powered units tend to need commercial level wiring into three phase power setups. 

The black and white icons are from the Subway icon set by [Mariusz Ostrowski](http://www.pixle.pl). Other icons were designed in Illustrator.

The Bold, high contrast colour scheme to highlight product features. The dark blue-greys frame the page, with the company’s red used for emphasis and focal points. 

##Future

- Plan to rework the products as Ajax objects, pulling items from the database to replace pagination by one page scrolling
- Shopping cart/wishlist. Replace much of remaing imagery with SVG
