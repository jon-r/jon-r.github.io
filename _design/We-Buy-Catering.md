<h2>Design</h2>
<p>
  The ‘We Buy Catering’ marketing campaign serves as an advert to purchase equipment for Red Hot Chilli Northwest. The microsite use a simple, one page design with basic mobile responsiveness. I also designed a range of mail leaflets targeted at a range of audiences.

Leaflets came first. Multiple Audiences
