Half of the challenge for second hand companies is sourcing the equipment. Unlike new stock that can often be supplied on demand, refurbishment retailers can only sell what they can get their hands on.
The ‘We Buy Catering’ marketing campaign serves as an advert to purchase equipment for Red Hot Chilli Northwest. The microsite use a simple, one page design with basic mobile responsiveness. I also designed a range of mail leaflets targeted at a range of audiences.
##Features
- Assorted leaflets, designed for multiple target markets.
- Blue monochrome colour palette.
- Minimal asymmetric design, designed to be quick to scan information.
- SEO friendly content, responsive design
- Simple php template allows quick duplication of design for different themes
